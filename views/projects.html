                            <h3>Overview</h3>

                                Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) uses computational methods to examine and classify human emotions based on facial expressions. 
                                The project aims to develop an advanced FER application using machine learning techniques, specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
                                to identify seven distinct emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. 
                                The objective was to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based approach in recognizing emotions under various circumstances. 
                                The model was tested using local system environments as well as Google Colab, achieving an accuracy of 62.71%. Despite challenges 
                                such as dataset imbalance and computational limitations, these results demonstrate the potential of deep learning in emotion recognition tasks, 
                                though further tuning and refinement are needed to improve the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

                            <h3>Dataset</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FER-2013</a> dataset was used to train our CNN. 
                                The dataset consists of two main folders, one for testing and one for training. 
                                The training dataset consists of 28709 examples used to train the model to identify emotions from the following seven facial expressions: 
                                anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. However, each emotion in the dataset has varying amounts of data. Anger contains 3589 photos, 
                                disgust has 436, fear has 4097, happiness has 7215, neutral has 4965, sad has 4830, and surprise has 3171. 
                                The test data contains 3589 examples that are used to test the model. Collectively, the selected dataset has 56.51 MB of data. 
                                Each data sample in the FER-2013 dataset is grayscale and the images' dimensionality is 48x48. 
                                This simplifies the data preprocessing step and ensures that our model can consistently learn and differentiate between emotions. 
                                Likewise, each data sample is variably unique due to the lighting, facial obstructions, and viewing angles, enabling the model to improve its generalizability.
                                Examples of each emotion:

                                At the end of the project 2 models were produced with performance around 60-65% accuracy.

                                The Silverlight discord bot, is an application made in Python that interacts with Discord's api.
                                Some of the functionalities include: games like TicTacToe and Hangman, prototype poem N-gram model made using TensorFlow,
                                and reading information/activities from users in the server.

                                If found on the server, the bot will see if the user is listening to a song.
                                If they are, it will display information about the song and allow the user to listen along.
